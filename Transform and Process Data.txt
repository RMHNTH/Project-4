
-- View that display  average rental per customer
Step 1: Calculate average rental duration using function TIMESTAMPDIFF,
        this function return the difference between given date as a day.
Step 2: Group the average calculated by customer_id to get average rental duration
        per customer
Step 3: Create a view that display customer_id and the average time it took each customer to
        return a dvd.
CREATE VIEW rental_duration
AS 
SELECT customer_id,
       AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(day, rental_date, return_date)) AS average_rental_duration
FROM rental
GROUP BY customer_id


-- View that display number of DVDs rented per customer
Step 1: Count total dvds rented by each customer and from which district they belong, 
        inventory_id uniquely identifies each dvds.
Step 2: Group the counted dvds by customer_id and district
Step 3: Since customer_id and district belong to different tables, join the customer table
        and address table using JOIN 
Step 4: Create a view that displays the number of dvds rented by each customer and
        their district.
CREATE VIEW total_dvds
AS 
SELECT c.customer_id,
       district,
       COUNT(inventory_id) AS total_dvds_rented
FROM address AS a
JOIN customer AS c
ON a.address_id = c.address_id
JOIN rental AS r 
ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, district;

-- View that display the district, total count of unique customer IDs that 
   rented DVDs in each district, total DVDs rented, and average rental duration 
   in each district.
Step 1: Join address table, customer table, total_dvds view and rental duration view
        using JOIN
Step 2: Count customers per district using COUNT function, sum all rented dvds per district 
        using SUM function and calculated average rental duration per district Using AVG function
Step 3: Create a view that display district where the customer/customers belong, total
        dvds rented and on average how long it customer/customers to return dvd/dvds in that
        district.
CREATE VIEW valuation_report
AS
SELECT a.district,
       COUNT(c.customer_id) AS total_customers,
       SUM(total_dvds_rented) AS total_dvds_rented,
       AVG(average_rental_duration) AS average_rental_duration
FROM address AS a  
JOIN customer AS c 
ON c.address_id = a.address_id
JOIN total_dvds AS t 
ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id
JOIN rental_duration AS r 
ON t.customer_id = r.customer_id
GROUP BY a.district;
